<p>If you hang around a campus ministry for a while, you're guaranteed to hear people talking about vocation-- what God is calling us to in our lives. People sometimes get stuck thinking that only certain types of jobs, like preaching or nursing, can be vocations which help bring God's kingdom in to the world. Not true! God calls people to all types of work for the good of the world.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this on a recent trip to the salon. The woman who did my hair had a gift not just for the technical aspects of her job, but also for asking questions and communicating to make sure clients leave happy. She had grown up fixing her siblings' hair, and always felt drawn to hands-on, creative work. She had the type of personality that made time in the salon chair fly by. The service she provides isn't just about vanity; it's also about confidence, and self-care, and looking professional enough to get a good job. You may say she wound up in the perfect career all thanks to a good guidance counselor, but I've been hanging around campus ministry long enough to smell a conspiracy.</p>
