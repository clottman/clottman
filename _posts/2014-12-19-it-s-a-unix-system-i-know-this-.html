<p>A couple days ago I finally broke down a and bought a Mac. Why? I was struggling yet again to install a Web development framework on my windows machine. </p>
<p>I used to dual boot Ubuntu, but needing to reboot to work on a project meant I rarely felt I had enough time to make working on projects worthwhile. When I upgraded to Windows 8.1 from Windows 7, I decided to try going without. </p>
<p>Even with the RailsInstaller for Windows that helped a bit, I still had problems trying to configure a PostgreSQL database. </p>
<p>Fast forward to this week, and I'm trying to install npm, a powerful command line tool for Node.js, and it's just not working. I did what any reasonable person would do: bought a new computer. </p>
<p>Ok, that's a bit of an exaggeration. My computer is pretty slow and has some annoying driver issues. I've been thinking about upgrading for a while-- but struggling to install another framework clearly built for Unix was the last straw.</p>
<p>Now that it's here, I'm getting set up to take full advantage. I wrote a simple script to install some of the basic apps I'll need, installed oh-my-zsh to improve my command line productivity, and have been looking at dotfiles setups to find more ways to bask in the Unix glory.</p>
