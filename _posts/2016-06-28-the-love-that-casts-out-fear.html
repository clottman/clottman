<p>Today the world is filled with uncertainty and fear. There is financial uncertainty, over Britain's impending exit from the European Union and middle class fears about job losses due to immigration and technological change. There are deep fears about immigrants and the perceived risk posed by foreign refugees. There is fear over the real risk that increased immigration will change the culture and privileged status that white Americans have enjoyed over the past decades. White people are afraid of black people, and black people are afraid of unchecked state slaughter of their bodies and rights. There are political fears on both sides of the aisle: state surveillance, nuclear negotiations with Iran, corrupt politicians, guns being sold or taken away, Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The church has an important message to preach: perfect love casts out fear. We need not fear the loss of status, money, or power because God loves us and accepts us as we are, no strings attached.</p>
<p>It doesn't take long for this to turn into a dangerous and hurtful platitude. Can't pay the electricity bill this winter? Jesus loves you!</p>
<p>God didn't just offer some kind words and leave it at that, however. God loved us so much that God did something about it, by sending Jesus to show us God's love directly. In order for the church to preach perfect love that casts out fear, we also must work to demonstrate that love in a tangible way.</p>
<p>It is not enough to tell the black mother, "Have no fear, God is with your child." The church must say, "We are here with you in your fear and pain, and we are with you on the path towards police reform." This is the kind of love that casts out fear.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is not enough to say to the one who fears immigrants "have no fear." We must meet her where she is, work to understand her concerns, and use dialogue and encounter with the other to help her see that in light of the Gospel, it's okay to choose hospitality instead of fear.</p>
<p>So many issues that we are facing today come down to deep-rooted fears. The church is well-positioned to respond to those fears by encouraging dialogue, reflection, and relationship building. It is not enough to simply dismiss fear. By following Jesus's model of encounter, acts of love, and non-judgmentalism, the church can channel the love of God which casts out the violent fear plaguing so many aspects of public life.</p>
