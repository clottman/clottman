<p>A friend of mine recently posted an opinion piece from the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">New York Times</span> called <a title="What's the Point of a Professor" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/opinion/sunday/whats-the-point-of-a-professor.html" target="_blank">"What's the Point of a Professor?"</a> on how college professors used to be revered by their students as moral authorities who could help them seek higher knowledge in their field and ultimately, meaning in their life. Today, students have significantly less engagement with their professors outside of class. I can relate. I go to lectures, but I don't often engage teachers outside of class unless I'm really stuck on an assignment--and even then, only if I have already gone through a list of classmates and teaching assistants who could potentially help. In my classes in the Raikes School, I do engage with teachers during class and have developed good relationships with them. I especially think of my software engineering and software design lectures as courses in which I really engaged the material and the instructor. Yet I have not received the kind of mentorship in academia the author describes as having taken place in decades past.</p>
<p>However, I <em>have</em> found a rich, nurturing, and challenging environment to ask questions of meaning and engage the mind of an adult mentor who I have come to admire and respect. Believe it or not, (probably not if you believe the narrative about people my age and religion), I have found this intellectual home inside the walls of a church. One of my homes on campus is a place called <a title="NeLCM - Lincoln" href="http://www.nelcm.com/locations/lincoln-lincoln-ne" target="_blank">The Lutheran Center</a>- a campus ministry rooted in the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (<a href="http://www.elca.org/" target="_blank">ELCA</a>) but certainly not restricted to people of my denomination. The Lutheran Center has helped me to grow, not just because of uplifting worship or the opportunity to take on leadership roles, but because it is a place where I have experienced Christian community at its best. The Lutheran Center is a place where I have experienced church that isn't just on Sunday mornings- the building is full and bustling with life nearly every day of the week. Students stop by to drink coffee and do, or avoid doing, homework. Students volunteer together, hang out together, and are there for each other when someone is hurting. I have learned the most at the Center not from organized Bible studies or skilled preaching (though we have both), but from the opportunity to ask questions and wrestle with potential answers. Sometimes the discussions are just between students, but often the pastor or the seminary intern are present and participate.</p>
<p>Beginning with discussions like these, I have developed a strong relationship with my pastor over the last three years. He is the person who first pulled me in to more active engagement with the community, and he continues to do so. I have gone to him at some of the lowest points in my college career, and he has helped me to see how the way I perceive certain issues points to the way I understand meaning and the place of God in my life. He challenges me to go past a naive understanding of faith and to think critically about what God might be calling me to in my life.</p>
<p>When I was reading the the article mentioned above about the lack of mentorship in modern academia, one particular passage stuck out:</p>
<blockquote><p>One measure of interest in what professors believe, what wisdom they possess apart from the content of the course, is interaction outside of class. It’s often during incidental conversations held after the bell rings and away from the demands of the syllabus that the transfer of insight begins and a student’s emulation grows. Students email teachers all the time — why walk across campus when you can fire a note from your room? — but those queries are too curt for genuine mentoring. We need face time.</p></blockquote>
<p>My pastor has given me, and countless other students at The Lutheran Center, the face time we need. Incidental conversations, held just after Wednesday worship or between classes on a weekday, away from the demands of the liturgy, help transfer insight. My pastor is a model of a minister who clearly loves his job and has a big impact on his parishioners. Maybe that's why so many students who grew up in this campus ministry have gone on to seminary. Even for those that don't, my pastor has had a huge impact on how students understand their faith and how they plan to live their lives after graduation.</p>
