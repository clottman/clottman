<p><em>Here's something else I wrote a while back: a sermon I preached at the Lutheran Center on September 9. </em></p>
<blockquote><p>Matthew 16:13-20</p>
<p>Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, ‘Who do people say that the Son of Man is?’ And they said, ‘Some say John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.’ He said to them, ‘But who do you say that I am?’Simon Peter answered, ‘You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.’And Jesus answered him, ‘Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.’ Then he sternly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a young adult, the last thing I want to be compared to is an infant. I’m a senior in college, living on my own, eating vegetables regularly by my own volition. I set my own bedtime and own a vacuum machine. I clean my apartment once a month. At least, that’s the plan… it’s only been three weeks but it hasn’t happened yet. So maybe I’m not an accomplished housewife yet, but I am <em>not</em> an infant.</p>
<p>I have been called wise beyond my years, and growing up got made fun of for being the ‘smart’ girl. Studying computer science has taught me to think in a logical, structured fashion. Hanging out with other computer science students has somehow indoctrinated me into using this kind of structured processing in my daily life, and I’d like to think it’s made me more wise. That’s what we’re in college to do, right—to learn the stuff that adults know; to learn to do the things that adults do and live our lives like adults. To develop the ability to question the wisdom we’ve received, and decide which parts are worth living by.</p>
<p>I like asking questions, and questioning my beliefs, but sometimes it causes me trouble when it comes to religion. The more I think about my faith, the more I realize that I don’t have a clue what’s going on. The more I learn about the Bible, the more questions I have. I realize that the stories I learned in Sunday School were condensed versions of the real thing, and that the Bible contains a lot more details that make the stories way less cut and dry. Like, Hagar? Does she even show up in Sunday School storybooks? I learn that Jesus wasn’t preaching the sermon on the mount and healing folks every day – sometimes he was being mysterious and frankly not very nice. What on earth was he up to? Then there’s the overarching question of whether this God full of grace even exists.</p>
<p>Every few weeks, I end up in mental agony over some burning theological point I just can’t wrap my head around. I know not all questions can be answered, but some of them still seem BIG and IMPORTANT and if I don’t figure it out THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING. Sometimes it’s even a question I’ve wrestled with before. I forgot the answer but I need to remember so I can figure out how the answer to this question fits in with the rest of what I believe because otherwise my whole belief system falls apart so I just need to remember so I can just go to sleep it’s 3 am and this is getting ridiculous.</p>
<p>This constant struggle with questions makes me jealous of Peter in this text. In the one where Jesus is talking to Peter about Jesus’s identity, Peter just knows. He <em>gets it.</em> The text doesn’t show him up all night or banging down the pastor’s door or getting in to a passionate debate about it with the other disciples. No one has to tell him or convince him, he just knows.</p>
<p>May I remind you that Peter never gets the right answer to any of Jesus’s questions. Why does he get to hit this most important nail on the head? And yet, as soon as Peter gets something right about Jesus, Jesus tells him to keep it quiet. Maybe the other people need to get it straight from God, too. Or, maybe they’re not ready to understand, because they haven’t seen the cross &amp; resurrection.</p>
<p>I want to understand Jesus, and believe in God, with certainty from within like Peter has. Sometimes I feel like I do, but often I could really a use a push—a simple “It’s me, God” written in the clouds on the way home from class or something. It’s super frustrating, but the other text today, Jesus’s prayer, suggests that the hiddenness of God could actually be all part of the plan.</p>
<p>That seems so unfair – like come on God, I’m doing my best here. The least you could do is fit some neat philosophical proof, or help me to believe more effortlessly. God’s apparent hiddenness can result in loneliness, anger, sadness, even anxiety. Certainly it doesn’t feel good. I need some sign or a breakthrough insight to get back to peace with God. And yet, whether I come up with a satisfying answer or settle into the realization that this is yet another thing I’m going to have to keep wrestling with for quite a while, peace in faith usually comes back once I stop struggling quite so hard to have all the answers in advance.</p>
<p>See, when I’m trying too hard and failing to reason it all out, it’s often because I’m trying to get Jesus or God to fit into the box I have in my head of what a god is like. The people in Jesus’s day thought he might be a prophet, or one heralding the arrival of the Messiah. There was no way <em>he</em> was the Messiah – Jesus the homeless healer didn’t fit into the box they had for what a Messiah was like.</p>
<p>Even though he got the name right, Jesus still has to spend the next few chapters convincing Peter that his power as a Messiah doesn’t look the way Peter wanted it to. Peter’s a smart guy, and so he thinks he knows what a Messiah should do and how a Messiah should act. He gets it wrong though, because Jesus shows that God’s power isn’t like the worldly power we’re used to.</p>
<p>Peter would be much better off if he shed his preconceived notions about Jesus – coming at the situation with a blank slate. Almost like… an infant. God’s hiddenness, and the sneaky ways God can reappear, force us to put aside our assumptions and our attempts to make God fit the neat little boxes we’ve drawn with our brilliant logic.</p>
<p>At some point, we’re forced to realize that even flawless human logic can’t contain or explain who God is. The only one who can reveal God is God, and it will happen on God’s timeline, not ours. Realizing it’s ok for us to have faith without having all the answers frees us to encounter a God who doesn’t fit in the boxes we already have. Instead, through faith which comes to us by God’s grace, we are free to imagine a radically different God whose power is most evident in the cross. In the dark places where we assumed God would be most hidden, we find to our surprise that God has been there all along.</p>
<p>Amen</p>
