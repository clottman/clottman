<h3>Sermon on Luke 18:18-34</h3>
<blockquote><p><span class="vv">18</span> A certain ruler asked him, ‘Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?’ <sup class="ww">19</sup>Jesus said to him, ‘Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. <sup class="ww">20</sup>You know the commandments: “You shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; Honour your father and mother.” ’ <sup class="ww">21</sup>He replied, ‘I have kept all these since my youth.’ <sup class="ww">22</sup>When Jesus heard this, he said to him, ‘There is still one thing lacking. Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.’ <sup class="ww">23</sup>But when he heard this, he became sad; for he was very rich. <sup class="ww">24</sup>Jesus looked at him and said, ‘How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! <sup class="ww">25</sup>Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.’</p>
<p><span class="vv">26</span> Those who heard it said, ‘Then who can be saved?’ <sup class="ww">27</sup>He replied, ‘What is impossible for mortals is possible for God.’</p>
<p><span class="vv">28</span> Then Peter said, ‘Look, we have left our homes and followed you.’<sup class="ww">29</sup>And he said to them, ‘Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, <sup class="ww">30</sup>who will not get back very much more in this age, and in the age to come eternal life.’</p>
<p><span class="vv">31</span> Then he took the twelve aside and said to them, ‘See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. <sup class="ww">32</sup>For he will be handed over to the Gentiles; and he will be mocked and insulted and spat upon. <sup class="ww">33</sup>After they have flogged him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.’ <sup class="ww">34</sup>But they understood nothing about all these things; in fact, what he said was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here Jesus goes again, giving out some impossibly high standard to someone who thought they had it all together. The wealthy young ruler thought he had all the boxes checked: on the secular side, he has power and money, he’s in the prime of his life, and for all we know, he probably has great hair. On the religious side, he’s dotted all his i’s and crossed all his t’s. Every commandment, he’s followed all his life. He claims he’s done so his whole life-  no wild freshman year for this guy.</p>
<p>Jesus says no, it’s not enough. Typical Jesus. Never satisfied. You’re probably familiar with one way to respond to this as Christians. We are faced with the law, which we can never live up to. In response good Lutherans lift up the Gospel, which offers grace and love regardless of our ability to live up to the ideal of the perfectly church-going, rule-following college student.</p>
<p>If, as good Lutherans, we know that the things we do will not ultimately determine our experience of salvation and grace in Christ, then why is Jesus making such a fuss here?</p>
<p>You might say that Jesus lifts up the supposed requirements so high in order to highlight our need for grace. You might be right. Let’s consider another option though. What if Jesus, in telling the man to sell all he has and distribute it to the poor, and give up his cushy life to follow the itinerant teacher, is actually issuing an invitation? What else could we say about the call to devote ourselves fully, no-holds-barred, to the Gospel of Jesus Christ?</p>
<p>To answer that, it’s time to take a detour way back in the past. Yes friends, we’re going back to the fall of 2012, when I was but a lowly freshman at UNL.</p>
<p>I started college in the Raikes School of Computer Science and Management, a super fancy subsection of the honors program with a demanding curriculum followed by a cohort of 30 students who go through the program together. There were only a few hard-and-fast rules about being in the Raikes School, but they were essential. If you broke them, you could be kicked out of the program – or worse, lose your scholarships.</p>
<p>The rules were fairly straightforward: enroll in all of the designated Raikes courses each semester. Earn above a certain grade in each of those classes, and maintain a certain GPA overall. Go to all the required speakers. Don’t climb over the wall of the balcony of Kauffman and walk on the roof.</p>
<p>The rules could definitely be stressful, but they came with some benefits. Students learned to work hard. They learned to study and juggle multiple ridiculous courses at once. We learned to relieve stress, and sometimes we found where our breaking points were. The rules helped teach us things we wouldn’t have known otherwise.</p>
<p>Despite all this, the rules were not the real draw of the Raikes School. The real draw was the magic that happened if you went above and beyond the requirements. If you threw yourself into the community, really devoted yourself to academics, and took advantage of the many networking and learning opportunities, your experience in Raikes could be so much richer.</p>
<p>Living fully into the Raikes School experience, you could find deep and joyful friendship. You could find a place to share your laughter and tears and nasty compiler issues. You could learn from your peers so much more than you’d just get from just going to class and isolating yourself in the library. In other words, you could have a much richer life by choosing to go beyond just the basics and devoting your whole body and soul to the common cause.</p>
<p>That’s really what Jesus is asking of the young man. It’s not just the act of giving money, it’s a fundamental reordering of his life and priorities in service of the Gospel. I think this re-centering on the Gospel is something we’re called to as individuals and as the church. Imagine what it could be like if the church took up this call.</p>
<p>Though they may not always be super formalized, there are some “rules” of being God’s church. We should have weekly services. Have a cross in the sanctuary. Hold some kind of Sunday School for the little ones, and celebrate the sacraments of baptism and communion. Hold some kind of potluck at least once a year. If I were to guess, I’d say 99% of mainline churches in the US abide by these rules.</p>
<p>The rules help order our common life, and point to our purpose as a community, in the same way that the commandments the young man in the reading followed helped order his life, and pointed to his calling as a child of God. The rules are nice, but as the church we are called to so much more.</p>
<p>What would it be like if our churches were radically centered on the Gospel? If we managed somehow to give up our sinful devotion to having power, and big parking lots, and a winning softball team (sorry Jacob). We are invited to direct everything the church does towards God’s love and saving grace.</p>
<p>If every time we had a chance to give, we gave generously, knowing everything we had comes from God. If every time we shared a meal together, we did so knowing that it is ultimately the Holy Spirit who provides the banquet and sustains our community. If every hour we spent out in the lounge, we spent with the knowledge that we were living out our vocation as a Christian community. If every time we prayed “God’s kingdom come,” we did so with expectance, and we ended the prayer energized to help make God’s coming world of love, grace, and radical hospitality a reality.</p>
<p>Every step the church takes towards being more radically centered on the Gospel brings us closer to seeing the kingdom of God here and now- as Jesus says, we will get back very much more in this age.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear, experiencing the kingdom of God does not depend on our sacrifice. God’s kingdom <em>will</em> come, whether or not we play along. However, we have the opportunity as the church to really live in to our calling as the church of God, especially now while the notion of being Christian in the United States is in need of a realignment with the loving embrace of the Holy Spirit. Our invitation is to participate in the work of the Holy Spirit in the world with all our hearts, and with all our minds, and with all our spirits. By extension, with all our resources.</p>
<p>That’s not to say we’ll necessarily see it for what it is when the kingdom breaks in. Jesus told his disciples about his future plans at the end of the reading, and they were so confused. It didn’t sound like they thought it would sound.</p>
<p>Will our participation in God’s plan look exactly like what we expect it to look? Almost surely not. It may not look all that great for the church in the worldly terms of membership numbers and public influence that we’re used to measuring ourselves by. It may even look crazy, like a powerful guy in the prime of his life selling all he has and skipping town.</p>
<p>We have the opportunity as the church, like the rich young man, to imagine what it would be like to turn our whole self over to Christ in devotion to living out God’s plan in every thing we do. It sounds crazy, and the results are not guaranteed to be as we expect. Nonetheless, we have an invitation to try. To participate in the work of the Holy Spirit, here and now.</p>
<p>Can we do it on our own?</p>
<p>No. We are too human?</p>
<p>Can it be done?</p>
<p>Without a doubt yes. What is impossible for mortals is possible for God.</p>
