On Friday, I led a short workshop for my coworkers on how to use the Mac's built-in screenreader, Voiceover, for accessibility testing.
<br />
<br />
I shared with them some statistics about our user population gathered from a survey about a year and a half ago. Our app has a handful of users (volunteers) who are totally blind, some who have physical limitations that make a mouse hard for them to use, and many more who are visually impaired in some way. Because we care about these users, it's important to make sure that all new features we add are discoverable and usable for people navigating with the keyboard or a screenreader.
<br />
<br />
I created <a href="https://glitch.com/~screenreader-practice">an app on Glitch</a>Â to help my coworkers practice after they went through the built-in tutorial for VoiceOver. Check it out yourself, and let me know what you think!
