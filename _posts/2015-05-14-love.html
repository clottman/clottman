<p>Do modern problems between religious people occur because those people have lost the fear of God?</p>
<p>Miroslav Volf proposed this interesting idea in a chapter of his book <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Allah: A Christian Response</span>. His friend, a monk, suggested that many conflicts in the world could be resolved if religious people were to realign themselves with the fear of God (or love of God, the term I prefer to use). Modern citizens may display strong religious attachment, but often religion-based social movements are more about building group identity than seeking God's will for the world. I see this especially among American Christians, where fitting in with the progressive or conservative camp often appears to be more important than pursuing an identity founded in God alone. Could a religious revival attempting to turn Christians away from their group alliances and towards the love of God really solve our country's political problems?</p>
<p>Volf writes that the most important commands for Christians are to love God, and love one another.* He argues that if people accept those two premises, those following the commands could unite in pursuit of the common good. I think the idea is worth exploring, though I'm very skeptical of how well it would actually work out.</p>
<p>To start off, it appears to me that many American Christians would reject Volf's claim that the commands to love God and neighbor are truly the most important aspect of Christian life. Some may say evangelization is most important; others may say a personal relationship with Jesus is most important. Whatever the alternative may be, I am sure that among the many branches of Christianity in this country, there is a substantial group that would be opposed to a revival based around those two claims.</p>
<p>Even if we accept that the love of God and the love of neighbor should be the focal point of Christian life, people can, in good faith, arrive at radically different conclusions in an attempt to follow these commands. Often we assume that those on the opposite side of a debate are simply uncaring or unfaithful, but the debate over gay marriage has shown me that this is not always the case. I have seen Christians who are in favor of gay marriage as a way to honor and support couples in committed relationships, and Christians who are against gay marriage because they truly believe such a marriage would be a detriment to the couple's health and standing in the eyes of God. Both sides can start with the goal of showing respect for God and love for individuals, but arrive at conclusions that leave them at a standstill. What are we to do about this? Volf offers no answers and merely implies that such conflicts would eventually work themselves out. If we are called to love our neighbor even when we fundamentally disagree, the debate may be civil as both sides work towards mutual understanding. However, there is no guarantee that this is possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, Volf assumes more piety of those who identify with a religion than I would. As mentioned above, he admits that conflicts between religious groups are often not really about religion or honoring God at all, but I think he underestimates the scope of the issue. Many Americans are ignorant or unaware of the realities of social ills such as race, poverty, and discrimination in the United States. In order for Americans to love their neighbors, they must get to know their neighbors. Therefore, any religious revival which turns people towards their neighbors must include an awareness component. This education piece may help with conflicts of good faith as described above, but the complex nature of the issues might mean that even well-informed, pious citizens could have a hard time agreeing on a right path.</p>
<p>* His book argues that these are also the most important commands for Muslims, though I intend to focus on American Christians for the purposes of this post.</p>
